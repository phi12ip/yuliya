# Hey Yuliya!

## ยง Git :
[Git Webpage](https://git-scm.com/)


This repo is where we can share code. Its public, so you can clone a copy using git on the command line:
``` sh
git clone https://github.com/phi12ip/yuliya.git
```

If you have never used git before, [this is a great introduction.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-basics-of-git-in-under-10-minutes-da548267cc91/)

After learning the basics, [this is a good resource](https://www.atlassian.com/git) to get information on how to do other procedures. If you want to know more about Git and Github, I can tell you more. 

There is also the [ProGit](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) book that is hosted online for free

## ยง VS Code :
 [VS Code Webpage](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
This is a great text editor/IDE that I use for everything. It can be extended by a ton of free Extensions availible inside of the application.

First off I would recomend checking out the [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs) for an overview of the interface. 

I would recomdend getting these Extensions: 

- Live Server
- Better TOML
- Prettier - Code formatter

and there are tons of others for any language you can think of so browse around

The feature I use the most is the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + P` . It brings up a input box where you do pretty much anything the IDE can do by just typing it in. `Ctrl + P` is also great for opening files in your workspace.
