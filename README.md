# Hey Yuliya!

## Git:

This repo is where we can share code. Its public, so you can clone a copy using git on the command line:
``` sh
git clone https://github.com/phi12ip/yuliya.git
```

If you have never used git before, [this is a great introduction.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-basics-of-git-in-under-10-minutes-da548267cc91/)

After learning the basics, [this is a good resource](https://www.atlassian.com/git) to get information on how to do other procedures. If you want to know more about Git and Github, I can tell you more.
